## How it works

The project is a 4-bit asynchronous up/down counter, at clk an external clock pulse is provided, it has a reset input pin, also an up(0)/down(1) count select input pin and 4 output pins.

## How to test

Counting is performed on the count [3:0] output pins automatically when the power is on, the reset input sets the count to zero and the select input controls the counting direction of the output pins.

## External hardware

A signal generator is required in case it is an asynchronous counter.
